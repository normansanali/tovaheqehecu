She shares the same parents with her two older siblings; Evelyn Juanita Currie and Ruby Alline Bullock.</p><p>She subsequently remembers picking cotton with her family as a young child while they resided in the surrounding rural unincorporated village of Nutbush, Tennessee, where her father worked as an overseer of the sharecroppers at Poindexter Farm on Highway 180.</p><p>Dr. Henry Louis Gates revealed her ancestral DNA test estimates, which were primarily African, about 33% European, and only 1% Native American, when she took part in the PBS documentary African American Lives 2 alongside him.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><a href=#>READ ALSO: Tina Turner Children: Meet Tina Turner’s Children</a></h4><p>She had previously thought that she had a sizable Native American background. Additionally, she is Eugene Bridges’ first cousin once removed.</p><p>When their parents moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, to work at a defense installation during World War II, the three sisters were split up when they were very young. Alex and Roxanna Bullock, who served as deacons and deaconesses at the Woodlawn Missionary Baptist Church, were the strict, devout grandparents of Bullock.</p><p>Following the war, the sisters relocated to Knoxville with their parents. Turner attended Flagg Grove Elementary School from first through eighth grade. Two years later, the family moved back to Nutbush to live in the Flagg Grove neighborhood.</p><p>Turner participated in the Spring Hill Baptist Church choir as a small child in Nutbush. Zelma moved to St. Louis in 1950 when she was 11 years old in order to get away from her abusive relationship with Floyd.</p><p>In 1952, her father wed a new woman and moved the family to Detroit, two years after her mother had abandoned the family. Turner and her sisters were transported to live in Brownsville, Tennessee, with their maternal grandmother, Georgeanna Currie.</p><p>She claimed that her parents didn’t love her and didn’t want her in her autobiography I, Tina.
