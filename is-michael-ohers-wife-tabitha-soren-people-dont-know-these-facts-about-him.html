After winning the Super Bowl with the Ravens in 2013, he spent four years with the Tennessee Titans before signing a two-year deal with the Carolina Panthers.</p><p>Oher has gone into solitude, away from the spotlight. There is little to no information regarding his personal life, including his wife and children, aside from the infamous Uber incident in 2017, in which he was involved.</p><p>However, there was recently some uncertainty about Oher’s marriage, which was utterly misinterpreted.</p><h2><span id=Oher_are_you_married_to_Tabitha_Soren>Oher, are you married to Tabitha Soren?</span></h2><p>Michael Oher’s marriage has been the subject of much conjecture. When one looks for Michael Oher’s wife on Google, one of the results is Tabitha Soren. And, while Soren is in some respects related to him, she is not his wife.</p><h2><span id=So_who_exactly_is_Tabitha_Soren>So, who exactly is Tabitha Soren?</span></h2><p>Soren is a fine art photographer and former NBC and ABC reporter from the United States. She is, in fact, the wife of American financial writer Michael Lewis.</p><p>Lewis is also the author of the 2006 book The Blind Side, which details Oher’s rough beginnings, adoption into the Tuohy family, and spectacular rise as a football player. The book was later converted into a film of the same name, which was released in 2009.</p><h2><span id=Oher8217s_Real_Wife_and_Information_on_His_Children>Oher’s Real Wife and Information on His Children</span></h2><p>Oher’s actual wife remains nameless, to say the least. There is minimal public information available regarding his wife and children.</p><p>Having said that, she runs a private Instagram account called @7tiff4tiff. Furthermore, Other’s wife’s name is Tiffany Michelle Roy, according to various reports.</p><p>Sean Tuohy Jr., UCF Football’s Director of Football Operations, uploaded a picture of Oher’s wife’s face on Instagram on August 10, 2015.</p><p>The Tuohy family, notably Sean Tuohy and Leigh Anne Tuohy, adopted Oher. As a result, the former NFL star and his wife Tiffany continue to have a good relationship with the Tuohys.</p><p>In another case, after Oher was involved in a notorious Uber incident, Oher’s wife made headlines. In July 2017, Oher allegedly assaulted an Uber driver while inebriated. Girma Berkessa, the driver, had been instructed to follow the car in which his “wife” was seated.</p><p>Oher later struck him after he informed Oher that the car they were following was going the wrong way. According to reports, the former American football player suspected the driver was attempting to scam him and challenged him.</p><p>Later that year, in October, Oher appeared in court. However, neither the accuser nor the defendant made their statements public.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Oher_Real_estate_mansion>Michael Oher: Real estate, mansion</span></h2><p>While Oher took great effort to keep his matters confidential, certain material did slip from time to time. Oher’s lavish estate is a perfect example.</p><p>In 2014, Oher spent a stunning $1.3 million for a magnificent mansion in Brentwood. Oher, if he were a bachelor, would not have purchased the mansion. The mansion, on the other hand, could be one of his NFL money investments.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Oher_Awards_Achievements>Michael Oher: Awards & Achievements</span></h2><p>He was chosen “First Team Freshman All-American,” “First Team All-Quad Freshman Chrome [AQFC] Tackle Letius,” and “First Team All-American.” In 2005, he was named ‘First Team SEC All-Freshman,’ and the following year, he was named ‘Second Team All-SEC.’</p><p>He was named to the ‘First Team All-SEC’ in 2007 and the ‘First Team All-American’ the following year, as well as the ‘Shug Jordan award as the ‘Southeast Offensive Lineman of the Year,’ as well as the ‘Colonel Earl “Red” Blaik Leadership-Scholarship Award.’</p><p>Oher was a finalist for the Outland Trophy, a finalist for the Conerly Trophy, a semifinalist for the Lombardi Award, and a finalist for the SEC Jacobs Blocking Trophy in 2008.</p><h2><span id=Personal_History_and_Legacy_of_Michael_Oher>Personal History and Legacy of Michael Oher</span></h2><p>In 2006, author Michael Lewis released a book titled ‘The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game,’ in which Oher was a subject. The section of the book concentrated on Oher, ‘The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game,’ was converted into a film of the same name, which was published in 2009.</p><p>In 2011, Oher released his autobiography, ‘I Beat The Odds: From Homelessness to The Blind Side and Beyond.’ This book was co-written with Don Yaeger, an American sports journalist.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Football Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Parris Campbell Jr. | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>Parris Campbell is one of the NFL's most ferocious competitors.
