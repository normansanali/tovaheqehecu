Derek Chauvin, a then-police officer seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death.</p><p>The mother of George Floyd’s daughter has made an emotional plea for justice, sobbing as she insisted he was a good man “no matter what anybody thinks”.</p><p>With her six-year-old daughter Gianna clinging to her, Roxie Washington said she wanted all four officers involved in Mr Floyd’s death to pay for the killing, which has sparked fierce protests across the US and the world.</p><p>“At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families. Gianna doesn’t have a father. He will never see her grow up, graduate. He will never walk her down the aisle.”</p><p>Ms. Washington made her remarks during a news conference at Minneapolis City Hall.</p><p>“He loved her, he loved her so much,” she said.</p><p>“I’m here for my baby. I’m here for George because I want justice for him, and I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gianna-floyd-age></span>Gianna Floyd Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gianna Floyd is 6 years old.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=parents></span>Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her parents are George Floyd and Roxie Washington. Roxie during a news conference in Minneapolis on June 2nd shared what his death means for their little girl. “I want justice for him because he was good, no matter what anybody thinks,” Roxie Washington told reporters at a press conference in Minneapolis on Tuesday.</p><p>“He was good and this is the proof that he was a good man,” she added, pointing at their daughter Gianna. “If there’s a problem she’s having and she needs her dad, she does not have that anymore,” Washington said.</p><p>https://twitter.com/capscore/status/1268021900518854659?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1268021900518854659&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fglobintel.com%2Fusa%2Fwho-is-gianna-floyd-george-floyds-daughter-bio-wiki-age-education-parents-go-fund-me%2F</p><p>She fought through tears during news saying that Floyd loved their daughter, and still provided for them after he moved from Texas to Minnesota. Gianna told CBS News that she has only happy memories of her dad.</p><p>“I remember when he used to take me outside … and then I used to get on his back and he used to carry me on his back all the time,” Gianna said. “It was super fun.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-samantha-marie-ware-wiki-biography-age-family-parents-height-instagram-net-worth></span>Who is Samantha Marie Ware?

Her attorneys say they won’t stop until justice is served.</p><p>When Washington first learned about Floyd’s passing, she told CNN that she didn’t know how to tell Gianna. Gianna would soon ask her mother why people on TV kept saying her dad’s name. Then, she wanted to know how Floyd had died.</p><p>“The only thing I could tell her is he couldn’t breathe,” Washington told CNN. She lamented that their daughter will miss Floyd through her life achievements.</p><p>“He would never see her grow up, graduate … he would never walk her down the aisle,” Washington said. “If there’s a problem that she’s having, she doesn’t have her dad anymore.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=go-fund-me></span>Go Fund Me<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A GoFundMe fund-raiser organized by the brother of George Floyd eclipsed $10 million in donations on Tuesday, less than a week after it was posted.</p><p>The fund-raiser was posted by Philonise Floyd six days ago, after the infamous caught-on-video killing of his brother George Floyd by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes.</p><p>The fund will cover costs for the funeral and travel costs related to court proceedings, according to the page. A portion of the pot also will be set aside for the care of Floyd’s children, according to the posting.</p><p>“From the bottom of our hearts my family thanks each of you who have reached out,” Philonise Floyd said in the GoFundMe page.</p><p>The fund-raiser’s goal was $1,500,000. The page has pulled more than 400,000 individual donations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BVpL%2BosYyfo6ixlKh6pa3UoJ%2BtnaKoeq%2Bx02auqKqknXqjtc6gqZqomK56p63CrWScmaKasrN5wLCYq5yjYq6vsIyloJ%2BdXajBsL7YaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgeorge-floyds-daughters-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html&text=George%20Floyds%20Daughters%20net%20worth%2c%20biography%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeorge-floyds-daughters-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-floyds-daughters-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html&title=George%20Floyds%20Daughters%20net%20worth%2c%20biography%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgeorge-floyds-daughters-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html&title=George%20Floyds%20Daughters%20net%20worth%2c%20biography%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-floyds-daughters-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html&title=George%20Floyds%20Daughters%20net%20worth%2c%20biography%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeorge-floyds-daughters-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html&description=George%20Floyds%20Daughters%20net%20worth%2c%20biography%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gilles-bensimon-net-worth-147743.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gilles Bensimon Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ddr5-demystified-feat-samsung-ddr5-4800-ranks-dpcs-do-manufacturers-matter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="DDR5 Demystified - Feat.
