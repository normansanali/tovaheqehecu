Deer are not going to respond to loud calling, and they will most likely not travel a far distance when responding to calls. Instead, they will let their curiosity dictate where they will travel.</p><span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on mossyoak.com</a><h2>Can you grunt call too much?</h2>One of the first rules of deer calling is not to use too many calls. Deer do not vocalize all of the time; therefore a hunter calling in excess will alert the deer of a red flag in the area, which will likely drive them away. Because deer aren't constantly bleating or grunting, you shouldn't be either. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on ninebarranch.com</a><h2>What call attracts deer the most?</h2>THE TOP 3 DEER HUNTING CALLS:<ul><li>BLEAT CAN.

If I'm on stand and hear a buck grunt, but can't see him, I'll immediately grunt back. If the buck is not with a doe he'll usually come looking for the deer that made the sound. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on community.legendarywhitetails.com</a><h2>Do grunt calls attract bucks?</h2>While doing this, a buck will make short grunts with almost every step he takes, which is why it is called a trailing grunt.

However, early season can be a great time to use this call as well. The difference between calling to deer early season compared to calling to rutting bucks in mid-November is the intensity of calling.
