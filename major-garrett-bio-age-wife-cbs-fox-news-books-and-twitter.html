But if he thought that his distinguished journalistic career had prepared him for the unique challenges of covering Donald Trump, he was in for a surprise.</p><p>Like many others in Washington, Garrett found himself having to unlearn many of his own settled notions about the nature and function of the presidency. He also had to separate the carnival-like noise of the Trump presidency from its underlying substance. For even in its first half, Trump’s tenure has been highly consequential.</p><p>In Mr. Trump’s Wild Ride, Major Garrett provides what journalists are often said to do, but usually don’t: a true first draft of history. His goal was to sift through the mountains of distracting tweets and shrieking headlines in order to focus on the most significant moments of Trump’s young presidency, the ones that Garrett believes will have a lasting impact. The result is an authoritative, mature, and consistently entertaining account of one of the strangest eras in American political history.</p><p>A consummate professional with unimpeachable integrity, remarkable storytelling skills, and a deep knowledge of his subject earned through decades of experience, Garrett brings to life the twists and turns of covering this White House and its unconventional occupant with wit, sagacity, and style. Mr. Trump’s Wild Ride should place him securely in the first rank of Washington journalists.</p><p><strong>Title</strong> Mr. Trump’s Wild Ride: The Thrills, Chills, Screams, and Occasional Blackouts of an Extraordinary Presidency<br><strong>Author</strong> Major<br><strong>Publisher</strong> St. Martin’s Press, 2018<br><strong>ISBN</strong> 1250185912, 9781250185914<br><strong>Length of</strong> 336 pages</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=major-twitter></span><span>Major Twitter</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by MajorCBS</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=garrett-youtube-major-garrett-explains-the-tense-moment-with-president-obama></span><span>Garrett Youtube | Major Garrett explains the tense moment with President Obama</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1foq6ru9FmnpqqoprBtXnBoqZmmZeaeri1xZ5knJqjYrOwxIynnLCrXZe8sLfSZpinnF2pxKrA056paA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmajor-garrett-bio-age-wife-cbs-fox-news-books-and-twitter.html&text=Major%20Garrett%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20CBS%2c%20FOX%20News%2c%20Books%20And%20Twitter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmajor-garrett-bio-age-wife-cbs-fox-news-books-and-twitter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmajor-garrett-bio-age-wife-cbs-fox-news-books-and-twitter.html&title=Major%20Garrett%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20CBS%2c%20FOX%20News%2c%20Books%20And%20Twitter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmajor-garrett-bio-age-wife-cbs-fox-news-books-and-twitter.html&title=Major%20Garrett%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20CBS%2c%20FOX%20News%2c%20Books%20And%20Twitter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmajor-garrett-bio-age-wife-cbs-fox-news-books-and-twitter.html&title=Major%20Garrett%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20CBS%2c%20FOX%20News%2c%20Books%20And%20Twitter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmajor-garrett-bio-age-wife-cbs-fox-news-books-and-twitter.html&description=Major%20Garrett%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20CBS%2c%20FOX%20News%2c%20Books%20And%20Twitter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mod-sun-net-worth-2024-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mod Sun Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./netgear-nighthawk-m1-lte-cat-16-router-1-gbps-carrier-aggregation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="LTE Cat 16 Router up to 1 Gbps">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
