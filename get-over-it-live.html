The lyrics express frustration with people who constantly play the victim and complain instead of taking responsibility for their lives. The opening lines of the song illustrate this sentiment when the singer turns on the TV and sees people who are always crying and blaming others for their problems. It paints a picture of a world where everyone is looking for someone else to blame.</p><br><p>The use of the phrase "get over it" throughout the song is a challenge to listeners to stop complaining and move on. The song asks people to stop playing the victim and stop blaming others for their problems. The line "You don't want to work, you want to live like a king / But the big, bad world doesn't owe you a thing" is a reminder of the harsh realities of life, that we have to work hard to achieve our dreams and not expect them to be handed to us on a silver platter. The song takes a dig at people who are always complaining and points out how counterproductive this attitude is.</p><br><p>In addition, the song's bridge makes fun of people who wallow in guilt and pain and wear it like a badge of honor. The singer points out that complaining and blaming others for one's problems do not help and instead bring everyone else down. The song's message is clear: stop blaming others for one's problems, take responsibility for one's actions, and focus on moving forward.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I turn on the tube and what do I see</u><br>I turn on the TV and see many people blaming others for their problems.</p><br><p><u>A whole lotta people cryin' "Don't blame me"</u><br>Many people are complaining that they are not to blame for their problems.</p><br><p><u>They point their crooked little fingers at everybody else</u><br>These people are pointing their fingers at others instead of taking responsibility for their own issues.</p><br><p><u>Spend all their time feelin' sorry for themselves</u><br>These people waste their time pitying themselves instead of fixing their problems.</p><br><p><u>Victim of this, victim of that</u><br>These people blame external factors for their problems and don't take responsibility for their own life.</p><br><p><u>Your momma's too thin;
