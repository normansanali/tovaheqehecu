Dorothy Parker, a New York-based American poet, writer, critic, and satirist, was celebrated for her sharp wit, clever banter, and keen observations of the idiosyncrasies of 20th-century urban life.</p><p>A lot of people have been inquiring lot about Dorothy Parker and making various research about her on the internet.</p><p>This article talks about Dorothy Parker and everything there is to know about her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Biography of Dorothy Parker</h2><p>Dorothy Parker (née Rothschild; August 22, 1893 – June 7, 1967) was a multifaceted American poet, writer, critic, and satirist, predominantly associated with New York. Renowned for her sharp wit, humorous repartee, and astute observations of the urban life quirks in the 20th century, she left an indelible mark on literature and culture.</p><p>Born as Dorothy Rothschild on August 22, 1893, at 732 Ocean Avenue in Long Branch, New Jersey, to J acob Henry Rothschild and Eliza Annie Marston, Parker’s early life was marked by familial challenges. Her parents’ return to Manhattan after the summer season in Long Branch solidified her status as a true New Yorker.</p><p>Growing up on the Upper West Side, Parker attended a Roman Catholic elementary school despite her Jewish father and Protestant stepmother. She displayed an early knack for humor but was reportedly asked to leave the school for her irreverent comments.</p><p>In 1914, Parker sold her first poem to Vanity Fair magazine, marking the beginning of her writing career. She transitioned to Vogue and later Vanity Fair as a staff writer. In 1917, she met Edwin Pond Parker II, a Wall Street stockbroker, whom she married before his deployment in World War I.</p><p>Parker’s career reached new heights when she began writing theater criticism for Vanity Fair in 1918. There, she joined the likes of Robert Benchley and Robert E. Sherwood, forming the famous Algonquin Round Table. Her wit and humor brought her national recognition as a brilliant conversationalist.</p><p>In 1925, when Harold Ross established The New Yorker, Parker’s work found a new home. Her short, sharply humorous poems became widely read. She published her first volume of poetry, “Enough Rope,” in 1926, followed by “Sunset Gun” (1928) and “Death and Taxes” (1931). Her short stories, notably “Big Blonde,” earned accolades and the O. Henry Award in 1929.</p><p>Parker’s talent extended to playwriting, and she collaborated with Elmer Rice on “Close Harmony,” which appeared on Broadway in 1924. She was also known for her acerbic book reviews under the byline “Constant Reader” in The New Yorker.</p><p>In 1932, Parker married Alan Campbell, an actor with screenwriting aspirations, and the couple moved to Hollywood. Their collaboration yielded multiple successful screenplays, including “A Star Is Born” (1937), for which they received an Academy Award nomination.</p><p>During the 1930s and 1940s, Parker embraced political activism, supporting civil liberties and civil rights causes. She was involved in various left-wing organizations and served as chair of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee’s fundraising arm.</p><p>In the 1950s, Parker faced backlash during the McCarthy era, being blacklisted by Hollywood studios due to her suspected communist affiliations.</p><p>Her tumultuous marriage to Campbell eventually ended in divorce in 1947, followed by remarriage and separation. Parker continued to write book reviews and returned to Hollywood in 1961, collaborating with Campbell on several projects until his death in 1963.</p><p>In her later years, Parker had a complex relationship with the Algonquin Round Table, and she occasionally participated in radio programs.</p><p>Dorothy Parker passed away on June 7, 1967, at the age of 73. In her will, she bequeathed her estate to Martin Luther King Jr. and, subsequently, to the NAACP.</p><p>Parker’s legacy endures through her literary works, sharp wit, and contributions to civil rights and liberties. She is remembered as a trailblazing humorist and a prominent figure in 20th-century American literature.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dorothy Parker Cause of Death</h2><p>Dorothy Parker passed away on June 7, 1967, at the age of 73.

Their marriage was strained, and she filed for divorce in 1928. Edwin later remarried and tragically died at a young age, either from an overdose of analgesics or sepsis following dental procedures.</p><p>After divorcing Edwin, Parker married Alan Campbell, an actor and aspiring screenwriter, in 1933. Their relationship was complex and marked by Campbell’s bisexuality, which Parker publicly acknowledged. They moved to Hollywood and collaborated on successful screenplays. However, their marriage saw periods of separation and reconciliation before ultimately ending in divorce in 1947. They remarried briefly in 1950 but separated again in 1952.</p><p>Despite the challenges in her marriages, Parker’s relationships with both husbands had a significant impact on her personal life and career.
