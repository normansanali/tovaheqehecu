Leeann is the wife of stand-up performer Bert Kreischer.</p><p>Born on 19th August 1971 in Bowdon, Georgia, Leeann is a writer and a host. She was brought up in her hometown and attended Bowdon High School.</p><p>After getting her degree in Bachelor of Arts, she shifted her residence to Los Angeles, California. At that period, she wanted to establish herself as a writer.</p><p>She worked as a painter before landing a role in&nbsp;Destiny Stalled&nbsp;in 2000. Likewise, she was cast for a minor role in 2002’s&nbsp;The Biggest Fan. She also penned down her writing skill in this teen comedy movie.</p><p>Leeann met her husband Bert Kreischer in 2001 in California as individuals trying to find their footing in their careers. In December 2003, the couple exchanged vows and became husband and wife.</p><p>They became parents in 2004 and added another one in 2006. Both children are daughters named Georgia and Ila Kreischer.</p><p>On 2nd February 2018, Leeann started her&nbsp;Youtube&nbsp;podcast, ‘ Wife of the Party.’ It has 267 episodes to this date.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=leeann-kreischer-weight-loss-transformation></span>Leeann Kreischer Weight Loss Transformation<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Leeann Kreischer weight loss transformation helped her lose 11 pounds in 2020. Leeann credits her trainer and diet plan for the change.</p><p>Bert Kreischer’s wife was only 108 pounds when she first encountered her husband. Over time, she gained weight and accepted mediocrity for herself.</p><p>She became a mother, and her lifestyle worsened as she added more pounds.</p><p>As a realization of a healthy life, she was motivated by Bert’s weight loss transformation and decided to give it a go. She does not entertain weight loss challenges like her better half but has her way of getting around things.</p><p>Leeann was proud to announce her transformation on her Instagram. She wore the shirt from 2003. She stated that she couldn’t wear it until now, i.e., 17th July 2020.</p><p>Her efforts helped her fit into the shirt she last wore in 2003. It was a great dedication and inspiration for everyone considering getting back in shape.</p><p>She keeps her hand away from greasy food and regularly exercises to remain at her modest weight class.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=leeann-kreischer-before-and-after></span>Leeann Kreischer Before and after<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Leeann Kreischer’s photo from 2015 and 2023 is contrastingly different. It was possible to lose weight as she made it a goal and followed her low-carb diet plan.</p><p>In the left photograph, Leeann looks a bit chubby. Her cheeks have more fat.</p><p>On the other hand, her latest photo represents her low fat. The photograph on the right reflects her glowing skin and slim body.</p><p>The credit must be given to her trainer, who designed a balanced exercise for her to reach her weight goal. She tried training herself, but she was quick to realize that mentoring and one-to-one sessions would be prerequisites if she wanted to see herself transform into a fitter and better self.</p><p>She stuck with her game plan and avoided high-calorie foods. Leeann seriously wanted to cut unnecessary weight and wanted a healthy life for herself and her family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=leeann-kreischer-and-workout-routine></span>Leeann Kreischer and Workout Routine<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Leeann Kreischer sticks to her workout routine and consumes healthy food. Her diet contains lean protein and low carbohydrates.</p><p>She was overweight by 20 pounds and needed to get rid of that. She wanted to get a stronger core and retain muscle power which would help her aging self.</p><p>On the&nbsp;YouTube&nbsp;podcast by Christina P, Leeann mentioned that she hired an instructor as she was unable to lose some fat. She also stated that she lost 11 pounds in 2020, all thanks to her trainer.</p><p>Besides exercise, it is necessary that the correct type of food is ingested into the system. Consuming more calories and burning fewer calories will not help reduce the fat. So, it becomes a necessity to carry the right diet plan.</p><p>On a similar note, Leeann’s morning starts with a glass of Athletic Greens. It is a supplement food powder made from whole grains, which is Keto friendly and gluten-free.</p><p>Likewise, she intakes eggs, coffee, and salad for her breakfast. The salad is typically spinach and broccoli with ranch.</p><p>Her meal contains lean protein, including pork loin, lean beef, fish, or plain greek yogurt. It also has some dark green vegetables to complement the protein.</p><p>She also consumed almonds and fruits to sustain her energy and keep away hunger.</p><p>Mrs. Kreischer loves gardening and has planted several fruits in her backyard. She has plums, red and green tomatoes, and oranges.</p><p>To keep her calorie in check, she likes cooking at home and making diverse dishes, mainly Italian. She is a proficient cook who likes making biscuits, oatmeal chocolate chip, chicken pot pie, cranberry walnut scones, and many other delicacies.</p><p>Her improvised diet plan helped her stay slim and get into the clothing she once discarded, and never dreamed about fitting into again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKSVmq6vuoykqZ6ho5i1pr6MsJyin5ipeq270qxkraqRo8Cnu9GmmK2hn6N6orrDZpuinaRk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fleeann-kreischer-weight-loss-transformation-and-diet.html&text=Leeann%20Kreischer%20Weight%20Loss%20Transformation%20And%20Diet&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fleeann-kreischer-weight-loss-transformation-and-diet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fleeann-kreischer-weight-loss-transformation-and-diet.html&title=Leeann%20Kreischer%20Weight%20Loss%20Transformation%20And%20Diet" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fleeann-kreischer-weight-loss-transformation-and-diet.html&title=Leeann%20Kreischer%20Weight%20Loss%20Transformation%20And%20Diet" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fleeann-kreischer-weight-loss-transformation-and-diet.html&title=Leeann%20Kreischer%20Weight%20Loss%20Transformation%20And%20Diet" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fleeann-kreischer-weight-loss-transformation-and-diet.html&description=Leeann%20Kreischer%20Weight%20Loss%20Transformation%20And%20Diet" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./maximilian-osinski.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Let's Talk About Maximilian Osinski - Height, Net Worth, Wife and Daughter">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./latest-marvel-news-deadpool-3-leaks-fuel-fears-for-a-worst-case-scenario-as-james-gunn-finally-answers-guardians-of-the-galaxys-big-burning-question.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Latest Marvel News: Deadpool 3 leaks fuel fears for a worst case scenario as James Gunn finall">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
