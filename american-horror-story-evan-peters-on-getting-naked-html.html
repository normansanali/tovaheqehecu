But he’s traded in the rubber for a similarly constricting straitjacket to play Kit Walker, an inmate at an insane asylum who is suspected of being a serial killer known as Bloody Face.

[<i>Laughs.</i>] I have a great picture of me naked on a bed just wearing a cock sock, and the crew is all around me, bored. We were all waiting for a film roll or a lens to arrive.

They have puppeteers. It’s a full-on big thing, like it’s really there in the room with me. It’s funny. I read <i>Fire in the Sky</i>, which is supposedly true. This guy says he’s abducted by aliens and all this stuff happened to him. Just thinking about that, if that were to really happen, if an alien were to come down and really abduct you, how terrifying and how earth-shattering would that be?

There’s [<i><a href=#>Mama</a></i>], and actually when I saw the preview for that one, I screamed. <i>Sinister </i>looks good. Last night, I was watching <i>Friday the 13th</i> because AMC was airing a creepy-movie marathon. I think it was <i>Friday the 13th 7 </i>or something. That stuff used to really scare me. Jason was the scariest when I was a kid. When I’d spend the night at a friend’s house and we’d watch these movies, I wouldn’t be able to sleep.
