There, she used to be a cheerleader, and later, she enrolled at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF). In 2003, she completed her graduation with a BA degree where she majored in Communications with an emphasis in television and video.</p><h2><span id=Ashley_Force_8211_Professional_career>Ashley Force – Professional career</span></h2><p>After completing her graduation, she started drag racing. As a Top Alcohol Dragster rookie in 2004, she won three of the season’s final five races, including the 50th annual Mac Tools U.S Nationals in Indianapolis and the season-ending Automobile Club of Southern California event in Pomona. In 2007, she joined her father’s company, John Force Racing, and drove a Mustang Top Fuel Funny Car sponsored by Castrol for her father’s team.</p><p>But the father-daughter team also made NHRA history by racing against each other. Ashley surprised everyone by beating her father with a time of 4.779 seconds and a high speed of 510.24 km/hr. She advanced to the semi-finals after her win, and in October 2007, she became the first female to reach the national series TF/FC final round at The Strip in Las Vegas Motor Speedway.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-196830 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ashley-Force-competing-at-the-drag-race.jpg alt="Ashley Force" width=650 height=487 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-196830 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Ashley competing at the drag race (Source: Instagram)</p><p>She advanced to the semi-finals after her win, and in October 2007, she became the first female to reach the national series TF/FC final round at The Strip in Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
