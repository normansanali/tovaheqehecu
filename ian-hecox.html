His favorite food is pink-frosted sprinkled donuts.</p><p>He and Anthony both attended Del Campo High School and after finishing school, went on to study at American River College.

He has a<strong> net worth</strong> of around $3 million as of November 2020.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Ian, along with Anthony, can be considered one of the most widely known YouTubers due to Smosh being one of the oldest channels on YouTube. Therefore, they write, direct, and star in the comedy sketches they have been creating since 2005. They have amassed over 6 Billion views and over 22 million subscribers on their Smosh YouTube channel. His most popular YouTube video is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Beef ‘n Go</a>.</p><p>The duo has also starred in Smosh: The Movie (2015), Angry Birds The Movie (2016), and Ghostmates (2016) among other things. Hecox made his television show debut as himself on the daytime talk show Today in 2015.</p><p>During Anthony’s time on the channel, he often appeared as dim-witted, ignorant, lazy, irritable, gullible, conceited, happy-go-lucky, and/or childish. He constantly demonstrated a lack of knowledge of the world. He was usually seen as less mature than Anthony, often going into temper tantrums or crying fits.</p><p>Even though he was usually shown as intellectually inferior to Anthony, there have been instances where he had been expressed as smarter than Anthony. He and Anthony guest-starred in Rooster Teeth Production’s Red vs. Blue: Season 9 as Insurrection soldiers in Episodes 3 and 15. They again star in Season 10 as Insurrection soldiers in Episode 2.

Source: Evening Standard</p><h4><span>Ian as Characterized in Smosh Videos</span></h4><p>He is shown to vary in being either more or less attractive to women than Anthony. He started an online blog to find someone who would date him, but every single one of the 30,698 votes declined. However, in the episode “5 Ways to Get a Girl,” he got attracted by a girl who was sympathetic to him crying, but she was never seen again.</p><p>In “His First Girlfriend,” he and Antoinette plan a wedding, but Anthony’s hypnotism makes him lose his sentence, thus resulting in Antoinette breaking up with him. In “The Famous Cheese Guy,” Anthony took a picture with a girl who enjoyed his cheese Melt-Down commercial, but when he moved in, the girl pushed him away and then spit on him.</p><p>His sexuality varies as well. In the episode “Smosh Snatchers,” Anthony claims that the only guy he would go gay for is McGyver, but he states that he thinks every guy would go gay for McGyver. In “EVIL FORTUNE COOKIE!”, he is given a fortune that says he and Anthony get married, so he asks Anthony to marry him. A disgusted Anthony refuses, telling him that he needs help, and walks away; in response, he starts crying and yells to Anthony that he would have divorced him anyway.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-79978 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ian-Hecox-vox.jpg alt="Ian Hecox" width=650 height=433 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-79978 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Ian Hecox and Anthony while speaking on the stage.
