Over the years, King has established her presence in the music industry with her distinctive and soulful voice, captivating audiences worldwide. With hit songs like "Ex's & Oh's" and "America's Sweetheart," she has garnered both critical acclaim and commercial success. As her career continues to flourish, it comes as no surprise that her net worth is projected to grow in the upcoming years. Elle King's undeniable talent and popularity position her as a rising star in the music scene, leaving fans eager to witness her continued success.</p><p><h2>Some Elle King images</h2></p><h2>Family, Mom, Dad, Wife & Husbands, kids</h2><p><b>Father:</b> comic actor Rob Schneider</p><p><b>Mother:</b> model <a href=#>London King</a></p><p>Her parents were encouragers, so they had a positive influence on Elle’s life. They honored and supported her lessons of acting, skating, playing musical instruments and other hobbies. She was born out of a typical Vegas marriage because her parents got married 3 days after their first meeting, so it’s no wonder they divorced soon after her birth.</p><h2>Boyfriends & Girlfriends, Relationship</h2><p><b>Sexual Orientation:</b> straight</p><p>The singer keeps saying that “Ox’s and Oh’s” is all about her boyfriends, so it’s obvious she had many of them in the past. She also says that her next boyfriend may be Drake or Fat Joe if it’s only up to her to choose! In Elle King’s biography, there are not so many talks and rumors about her boyfriends or affairs in 2015, and it seems like she didn’t have a lasting and happy relationship with any of her ex-boyfriends. She got hurt for the first rime, so she didn’t have much interest in dating later. Moreover, Elle wrote her song “Love Stuffs” based on her past experiences when being hurt many times. She is a successful and pretty woman with many fans following her on social networks, who needs to travel a lot with interesting people. So, everything is ahead for her.</p><h2>Elle King Money, Net Worth</h2><p><b>Net Worth:</b> The young singer succeeded a lot in her career and earned more than $1 million (2015).</p><h2>Houses & Cars</h2><p><b>Place of living:</b> King was born in LA, but grew up in southern Ontario. As of 2015, she lives in Bushwick, Brooklyn.</p><h2><span class=inline-icon>✎</span> More Info:</h2><p><b>How is Elle King pronounced correctly?</b></p><p>The right English pronunciation of her name is elle-king. By the way, this is what she says about pronouncing names: “If you pronounce your name with an accent, do I have to?”</p><p><b>Is Elle King overweight?</b></p><p>Her weight is 145 lbs, or 66 kg. The singer has a perfect height of 5 feet 6 inches, her body is hot and sexy, and that’s why she is so popular among American guys.</p><p><b>Has Elle King ever undergone a plastic surgery?</b></p><p>No, she likes being natural in this sense. She even has a chipped front tooth (it was accidentally hit with a microphone).</p><p><b>What is her real name?</b></p><p>Her real name is Tanner Elle Schneider. However, when she was 18 years old, she decided to take her mother’s last name because she was raised by her mom. However, her father, Ron Schneider, wanted his daughter to keep his last name. And Elle just wanted to be her own person!</p><p><b>What is Elle King’s nationality?</b></p><p>Her father has Jewish roots with Filipino and American ancestry, so the same can be said about Elle.</p><p><b>Is Elle King a feminist?</b></p><p>Some music fans think that she is, and the singer is often criticized because of her feminist “views” by the media. It’s worth mentioning that she wrote a song about what she would do if she was a man! Elle often repeats that she doesn’t hate men because she devoted her whole album to sleeping with them.</p><p><b>Is Elle King Jewish?</b></p><p>Yes, because her father Rob Schneider and her grandfather are Jewish.</p><p><b>What inspired her to write “Ex’s and Oh’s”?</b></p><p>In this song, Elle King sings about her ex-lovers and how they keep coming back to her wanting her again.</p><p><b>Is Elle King also an actress?</b></p><p>She’s got roles in 3 films. Her debut was in “Deuce Bigalow” in 1999 (where she played with her famous father), and the latest one is “Wild Cherry” in 2009 where she played Sabrina.</p><p><b>Does Elle Kind have tattoos?</b></p><p>The singer has more than 35 tattoos, and her favorite one (on the right hand) is devoted to her grandmother whom she lost in 2014. Her family used to call her Little One, and that’s why Elle got it on her hand, so now her dear grandmother is with her all the time. She also has the logo of AC/DC on her bicep, and some of her bad tattoos remind her brokenhearted experiences with her ex-boyfriends.</p><p><b>When did Elle King become first interested in music?</b></p><p>When she was 9 years old her stepfather gave her a nice present – a record of The Donnas, a top pop-punk band. The singer claims that it was a turning point when she decided to become a musician.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeVobmmecqipaBlnprBbsPOq6uhZWJlg3mBkw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2felle-king-net-worth-206854.html&text=Elle%20King%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2felle-king-net-worth-206854.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2felle-king-net-worth-206854.html&title=Elle%20King%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2felle-king-net-worth-206854.html&title=Elle%20King%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2felle-king-net-worth-206854.html&title=Elle%20King%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2felle-king-net-worth-206854.html&description=Elle%20King%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./erin-bolte.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erin Bolte - Bio, Age, Married, Nationality, Net Worth, Facts, Career">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dale-moss-posts-first-photo-with-clare-crawley-since-reunion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dale Moss Posts First Photo With Clare Crawley Since Reunion">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
