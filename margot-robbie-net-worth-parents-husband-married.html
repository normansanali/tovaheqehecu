This makes so much sense, the way nothing has ever made sense before.'"</span></strong></p><p><span>She has even shared <span>being married to be <strong>the most fun ever </strong></span>and she felt being&nbsp;<a href=#>someone’s wife</a>,&nbsp;she had a responsibility and wanted to do better.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span><strong>Who Are Margot Robbie Parents?</strong></span></h2><p><span>31 years old Australian actress, Margot Robbie, was born in Dalby, Australia to parents Doug Robbie (Father) and Sarie Kessler (Mother).
