In 2004, he was chosen as the first overall pick in the NFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers.&nbsp;He was immediately traded to the New York Giants, where he still plays today as an indispensable member of the successful football team.</span></p><p><span>With the Giants, Eli holds the record for most touchdown passes, most passing yards and completions in a career.&nbsp;He also holds the record for most touchdown passes in the fourth quarter of the season.&nbsp;Eli’s time with the New York Giants was not without trophies, leading them to victory in Super Bowls XLII and XLVI, where they beat the New England Patriots in both matches to emerge as champions.&nbsp;In each of those wins last season, he was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) and thus became one of five footballers to be named Super Bowl MVP.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family: wife, children</span></strong></h2><p><span>The celebrity footballer is happily married to college sweetheart Abby McGrew of Nashville, Tennessee.&nbsp;The two lovers tied the knot in a low-key wedding ceremony in San Jose del Cabo, Mexico on April 19, 2008.</span></p><p><span>Their union has since been blessed with the birth of three beautiful daughters namely;&nbsp;Ava Frances born March 26, 2011, Lucy Thomas, born June 17, 2013, and the youngest being Caroline Olivia, born January 29, 2015. During football season, the family resides at their home in Hoboken, New Jersey.</span></p><p><span>The family of five still lives together and there are no strong or weak rumors that the adults are thinking of separating.&nbsp;While they may have the typical issues of most male-female unions, they’re doing pretty well because it doesn’t make headlines and celebrity gossip.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body measurements: height, weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>Eli Manning stands at an impressive height of 6 feet 4 inches or 1.93 meters off the ground.&nbsp;His weight as an athlete is regulated at 67 kg while his height is usually set at 45 inches.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net worth, salary, house</span></strong></h2><p><span>Football in America is a very rewarding sport and Eli Manning has been well-regarded for his commitment and achievement in the sport.&nbsp;With an estimated annual salary of $18 million, his net worth is estimated at $115 million as of 2018, which puts him ahead of most other NFL players, who enjoy an excellent reputation in the sport..</span></p><p><span>Apart from his regular salaries as a footballer, he earns hugely from his myriad of endorsement deals, including his deals with Nike, Toyota Motor, DirecTV and Gatorade. With all that, his career earnings are the highest among the NFL’s most active players.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGidnJ56rq3Np6Cnn12stqexjJyfoqSUp7KvecWapKKkqWK1prXGoatmr5WetKnAjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIysmKWZoq56qbvUrJxo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feli-manning-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth-salary-house.html&text=Eli%20Manning%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20House&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feli-manning-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth-salary-house.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feli-manning-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth-salary-house.html&title=Eli%20Manning%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20House" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feli-manning-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth-salary-house.html&title=Eli%20Manning%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20House" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feli-manning-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth-salary-house.html&title=Eli%20Manning%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20House" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feli-manning-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth-salary-house.html&description=Eli%20Manning%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20House" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./veetejas-exploring-the-cultural-history-through-photography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Exploring the Cultural History Through Photography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./did-steve-harvey-wife-cheat-on-him-divorce-rumors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Steve Harvey Wife Cheat On Him | Divorce Rumors">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
