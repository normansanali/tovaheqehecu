Nevertheless, it is easy to see the influence that the franchise had on the genre.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hugh Jackman was brilliantly cast as Wolverine in the franchise, and the man became a legendary performer thanks to his time playing the character. Jackman's final Wolverine performance came in 2017's Logan, and fans were surprised to hear that the performer was willing to take a paycut for his swan song.</p><p>So, why did Hugh Jackman take a paycut for Logan? Let's take a closer look at Jackman's time playing Wolverine and find out from the film's director, James Mangold.</p><h2 id=hugh-jackman-was-iconic-as-wolverine>Hugh Jackman Was Iconic As Wolverine</h2><p>When looking through the list of iconic superhero performances, few come close to rivaling Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine. Fans might have groaned that the unknown Aussie was too tall for the character at first, but by the time Jackman wrapped up playing the character, he had turned into a legend of the genre.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>2000's X-Men was an important superhero movie that ushered in a new era for the genre, and Jackman began his time as Wolverine in the movie. Despite replacing another actor and nearly being fired a few weeks into filming, Jackman made the most of his opportunity and became a superstar on the big screen.</p><p>After delivering one excellent performance after the next in the franchise, Jackman wound up giving his final performance in 2017's Logan. His final performance could not have been better, and since its release, Logan has gone down as one of the best comic book movies to ever grace the big screen.</p><p>Jackman did well for himself while playing the character, making bank each step of the way.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Hugh Jackman Could've Destroyed His Career With A Major Flop That Lost Up To $70 Million</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-made-millions-playing-the-character>He Made Millions Playing The Character</h2><p>One of the benefits of playing a legendary character is making a monstrous salary, and you had better believe that Hugh Jackman was able to make bank while playing Wolverine on the big screen. He may not have started out making a premium, but as time went on, Jackman made a fortune.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, Jackman would pocket $500,000 for his first time playing Wolverine in X-Men, and things would only go up from there. By the time X-Men Origins: Wolverine hit theaters, Jackman was pulling down $20 million for playing the character, making him one of the highest-paid stars around.</p><p>During his time in the franchise, "Jackman earned near to $100 million for playing the character, considering upfront salary, promotional payments, as well as press appearances," per GQ.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jackman could have charged a premium for each outing as Wolverine, but for 2017's Logan, which was to be Jackman's swan song as the character, the actor took a decrease in pay.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>K-Pop Fans Attack Hugh Jackman For Unfollowing 'Stray Kids' On Instagram</a></span></p><h2 id=he-took-a-pay-decrease-for-an-r-rating>He Took A Pay Decrease For An R Rating</h2><p>So, why did Hugh Jackman agree to a pay decrease for Logan?</p><p>Back in 2016, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was confirmed</a> by director James Mangold that Jackman was willing to ditch a portion of his salary so that they could get an R rating for the film. Mangold and Jackman had been wanting to make a R-rated Wolverine flick, and they even had an R-rated version of The Wolverine, but the final release for that film was PG-13.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When speaking about the R rating, director James Mangold said, "[This represents] to me the kind of aggressive, classical Wolverine action that we want in the movie â€“ more of something that fans have been asking for, for a really long time. Weâ€™ve been limited in one way or another from giving it to them, but I think weâ€™ve got the go-ahead to really go for it on this picture. So weâ€™re really trying to deliver what folks have always imagined those kind of battles would look like. There is a lot of high-octane action in the movie. Weâ€™re just trying to do it very differently and very viscerally."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Hugh Jackman Cancer Scare Sends Twitter Into A Frenzy</a></span></p><p>Getting Logan the proper rating went a long way in the film turning out as great as it did. Some comic book movies benefit from an R rating, as we saw with both Logan and Deadpool. Thankfully, we are now in an era of filmmaking that allows for a little more wiggle room than before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This Actor Is The Reason Hugh Jackman Was Cast As Wolverine</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmn66fmGK3oq%2FKppinZaSkvKx5wGanmrGTqsFuss6rZKWnl5a7cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheres-why-hugh-jackman-took-a-paycut-for-logan.html&text=The%20Dark%20Reason%20Hugh%20Jackman%20Took%20A%20Paycut%20For%20%27Logan%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-why-hugh-jackman-took-a-paycut-for-logan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-hugh-jackman-took-a-paycut-for-logan.html&title=The%20Dark%20Reason%20Hugh%20Jackman%20Took%20A%20Paycut%20For%20%27Logan%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheres-why-hugh-jackman-took-a-paycut-for-logan.html&title=The%20Dark%20Reason%20Hugh%20Jackman%20Took%20A%20Paycut%20For%20%27Logan%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-hugh-jackman-took-a-paycut-for-logan.html&title=The%20Dark%20Reason%20Hugh%20Jackman%20Took%20A%20Paycut%20For%20%27Logan%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-why-hugh-jackman-took-a-paycut-for-logan.html&description=The%20Dark%20Reason%20Hugh%20Jackman%20Took%20A%20Paycut%20For%20%27Logan%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-the-average-height-of-a-wnba-player.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is the Average Height of a WNBA Player?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./best-graphics-cards-egpus.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The best graphics cards for an external GPU enclosure">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
