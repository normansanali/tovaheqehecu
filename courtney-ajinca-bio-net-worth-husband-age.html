And this was exactly why VH1’s reality series </span><i><span>My Celebrity Dream Wedding</span></i><span> existed. The show feared a team of A-list wedding planners including Courtney Ajinça who brought their client’s dream wedding to life on a minimum budget.</span></p><p><span>This Courtney Ajinça Bio explores everything you need to know about the reality star.</span></p><h3><b>Courtney Ajinça On VH1’s My Celebrity Dream Wedding</b></h3><p><span>Courtney Ajinça is an event planning master who first hit the spotlight in 2020 after launching a social series called </span><i><span>Floral Fridays</span></i><span>. Soon, besides wedding planning, the star also found herself offering online consultations and mentorships to people who wanted to become like her.</span></p><p><span>Naturally, she then caught VH1’s eyes and was invited to the cast of </span><i><span>My Celebrity Dream Wedding</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>According to Courtney, the VH1 show is her “biggest career flex since becoming an entrepreneur.” She mentioned that her first work on </span><i><span>My Celebrity Dream Wedding</span></i><span> featured a “very deserving bride and groom” who had their celebrity wedding just before COVID shut down the world.</span></p><p><span>Supporting Courtney on </span><i><span>My Celebrity Dream Wedding</span></i><span> were two other master planners — Lance Devereux (the owner and lead designer of </span><i><span>Designs by Devereux</span></i><span>), and Tori Williams (owner of </span><i><span>Tori Williams</span></i><span> Events).</span></p><p><span>Though Courtney now might be an accomplished wedding planner, she was never interested in the hospitality business. She wanted to become a doctor and even studied biology. But a twist of fate, she is here. “I’m so happy that I ended up here. I’ve finally found my passion and I’m walking in my purpose,” she shared.</span></p><p><span>Promoting her appearance on the show, Courtney took it to her IG on Dec 8 to write, “You guys have asked and now it’s FINALLY here!!!”</span></p><h3><b>Courtney Ajinça Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Courtney Ajinça flaunted a net worth of around $800 thousand by 2021.</span></p><p><span>This master planner started her career doing small events for her family and friends. Gradually, she then realized that she loved “getting people together and making them feel welcome.” Thus, it became her mission to make others happy.</span></p><p><span>Also, one day, her husband mentioned that she was pretty good at what she did and should think about doing it professionally. So, she did and never looked back.</span></p><p><span>Since then, Courtney has worked with several high-profile clients including Lebron James, Maverick Carter, Cynthia Bailey, Keisha Lance Bottoms (Mayor of Atlanta), and Mimi Faust.</span></p><p><span>A visionary within her industry, Courtney continues to turn fantasy into reality as a vivacious mastermind. Besides planning, she also offered classes to budding entrepreneurs in her industry</span></p><p><span>Her services were categorized into — Interior Design, Event Design, Lifestyle Design, and Master Class.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, her site also sold a few flower vases.</span></p><p><span>So far, the most challenging time in her career was 2020. “I lost 90% of my contracts and it was very difficult,” she shared. But as the COVID pandemic started to subside, a lot of corporate clients began to book her for 2022 events.</span></p><p><span>As for her education, Courtney graduated from </span><i><span>Independence High</span></i><span> and went on to join </span><i><span>Wingate University</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Courtney Ajinça Age</b></h3><p><span>Courtney Ajinça was born on November 12, 1988. That made her 33 years of age in 2021.</span></p><p><span>Corrpesding to her birthday, she is of the Scorpio zodiac.</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Courtney Ajinça Husband?</b></h3><p><span>Courtney Ajinça’s husband is the former NBA player Alexis Ajinça. The two first met on Facebook in 2010 through a mutual friend and it was Courtney who first slid into the basketball player DMs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Three weeks after making our relationship official, I had keys to his place,” Courtney recalled.</span></p><p><span>Fast forward to 4 years of dating, the couple had their fairytale wedding on March 10, 2014, and went on to have 2 kids together.</span></p><p><span>They are a true example of a couple who kept love at the center of turmoil, transition, and triumphs. They have been through a miscarriage, and despite their tough work schedules, the husband-wife always sailed the storm together.</span></p><p><span>According to Courtney, their secret to a “healthy love life and marriage” was making time for each other. “Whether it be a movie, lunch, or just a walk, we make time for each other,” she said.</span></p><p><span>And for any newly married couple, she asks them to follow these three things — communicate, have patience, and spend time with each other.</span></p><p><b>Trivia: </b><span>Courtney’s maiden name is “Sadler”.
