She was 99 years old. Her death, which came three weeks before her 100th birthday, was confirmed by her agent and friend, Jeff Witjas. “Even though Betty was about to be 100, I thought she would live forever,” Witjas said in a statement to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a>&nbsp;at the time. “I will miss her terribly and so will the animal world that she loved so much. I don’t think Betty ever feared passing because she always wanted to be with her most beloved husband Allen Ludden. She believed she would be with him again.”</p><p>How did Betty White die? White died in her sleep at her home in the Brentwood neighborhood of west Los Angeles at around 9:30 a.m. PT on December 31, 2021, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>. “Betty died peacefully in her sleep at her home early this morning,” Witjas told People. In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a>&nbsp;before her death, White expressed her excitement at turning 100 years old. “I’m so lucky to be in such good health and feel so good at this age,” she said at the time. “It’s amazing.” White also joked about her secret to a long life. “I try to avoid anything green. I think it’s working,” she said.</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-3=processed>Witjas confirmed in an interview with People at the time of White’s death that the comedian made him a “promise” to live to 100 years old, which she almost kept. “She was an incredible lady. Hard to put into words,” he said. “We had a special relationship, far more than just a client.” He continued, “We became really good friends and we always laughed no matter what we did. She was always positive and she always saw the bright side. She promised me she would live to 100 — and she almost did.”</p><p>Witjas also told People that he and White would often joke about her 101st birthday because they were so sure she’d live to be 100. “We kidded. I said, ‘Betty, we know you’re going to turn 100. Let’s start focusing on 101.’ I mean, that’s really how we kidded around,” he said. “She never made it a big deal.” Though White never made a “big deal” about her age, Witjas did recall White telling him,&nbsp;“Wow, that’s a pretty large number,” when she realized how close she was to turning 100 years old. He continued,&nbsp;&nbsp;“But we didn’t sit there and say, ‘Betty, how did you do it? What did you do?’” He also told People that White would often joke about her diet.</p><p>Witjas also explained why White chose not to replace her golden retriever Pontiac who died a few years ago.&nbsp;“I had asked her if she wanted another animal, and she said to me she would prefer not because if she got a puppy or she went to a shelter, she’d always figured that the dog would outlive her,” he said. “And I would kid her. I said, ‘Betty, you’re outliving everybody. You’re not going anywhere.’ But she was so sensitive to animals.” As for what her life represents, Witjas said, “Her work speaks for itself. Her legacy was sealed. It was sealed years ago.”</p><h2>What was Betty White’s cause of death?</h2><p data-skm-boomerang-el-3=processed>What was Betty White’s cause of death? White died of natural causes and didn’t have any specific illnesses or ailments, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>. After her death, there was a rumor that White died three days after she received the booster for the COVID-19 vaccine on December 28, 2021. The rumor came from an alleged quote from White about the COVID-19 vaccine, which users shared on Twitter and Facebook after her death. “Eat healthy and get all your vaccines. I just got boosted today,” read the quote, which users would share with a link to an article by the Minnesota news outlet, Crow River Media, with the headline, “Betty White: I’m lucky to still be in good health.”</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Associate Press</a>&nbsp;confirmed that the quote—which was used to connect White’s death to the COVID-19 vaccine—was fake. Witjas also told the AP that the quote isn’t real. “Betty never said this,” he said. He also confirmed that White didn’t receive the booster for the COVID-19 vaccine three days before her death and died from natural causes. “Betty died peacefully in her sleep at her home. People are saying her death was related to getting a booster shot three days earlier but that is not true,” he said. “She died of natural causes. Her death should not be politicized — that is not the life she lived.” He continued, “She never said that regarding the booster. Betty died of natural causes. She did not have the booster three days before she died.”</p><p>Though White died of natural causes, Witjas confirmed to People that White was under a doctor’s care in the final months of her life due to the pandemic.&nbsp;“[She] was really simply spending each day at her home. She didn’t go out. She was under a doctor’s care, not for any reason, other than just being careful with COVID,” he said.&nbsp; I know there was a period where she would address all the fan letters. I think, she just didn’t have the energy to respond the way she used to. She was reading, she just lived her life. She was home in her comfortable surroundings.”</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-3=processed>Witjas also told People that he didn’t know if White fully understood how loved she was by her fans.&nbsp;“I don’t know if she ever embraced it, [or] really, really felt it. The extent of it. I really don’t,” he said. “I would always reinforce it with her because I always felt she should know that. I never wanted her to think while she was sitting at home, that the world has passed her by. It never did.” He continued, “Betty lived a great life and she lived a life that she chose. She was happy,” Witjas adds. “Every time I told her, ‘Betty, you’re loved,’ she would look at me with a wry smile and say, ‘Really?’ I hope she knew. I think she did. It was something beyond love.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOsJ%2BarF2srrR5wZ6rrbFdrLWqwMSsZKedpGLEsL7ToWSwoJWjerS0xGabop2UZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-was-betty-whites-net-worth-when-she-died.html&text=What%20Was%20Betty%20White%27s%20Net%20Worth%20When%20She%20Died%3f%20Hollywood%20Pays%20Tribute%20to%20Betty%20Whites%20Death.&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-was-betty-whites-net-worth-when-she-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-betty-whites-net-worth-when-she-died.html&title=What%20Was%20Betty%20White%27s%20Net%20Worth%20When%20She%20Died%3f%20Hollywood%20Pays%20Tribute%20to%20Betty%20Whites%20Death." target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-was-betty-whites-net-worth-when-she-died.html&title=What%20Was%20Betty%20White%27s%20Net%20Worth%20When%20She%20Died%3f%20Hollywood%20Pays%20Tribute%20to%20Betty%20Whites%20Death." target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-betty-whites-net-worth-when-she-died.html&title=What%20Was%20Betty%20White%27s%20Net%20Worth%20When%20She%20Died%3f%20Hollywood%20Pays%20Tribute%20to%20Betty%20Whites%20Death." target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-was-betty-whites-net-worth-when-she-died.html&description=What%20Was%20Betty%20White%27s%20Net%20Worth%20When%20She%20Died%3f%20Hollywood%20Pays%20Tribute%20to%20Betty%20Whites%20Death." target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-edward-woodward-see-net-worth-quote-awards-fact-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Edward Woodward?
