He became famous after what some might call a controversial entanglement. Thomas made headlines in 2018 in The New York Post after famously dating and marrying call girl Ashley Christine Dupree, the woman known for bedding former New York governor Eliot Spitzer.</p><p>As the New York Post exclusively revealed, Thomas Earle’s relationship with Ashley culminated at Gramercy Park. The romance started at a Jersey Shore eatery. Thomas said he would have had Ashley for free, and a week later, she was spotted drooling over him.</p><p>Thomas Earle is one interesting personality, causing us to look at his affair, job, and family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/e81da6a1684718e1072bc5c65c0b9c7a-fotor-20230708143335.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Thomas_Earles_Controversial_Relationship_With_an_Ex-Call_Girl></span>Thomas Earle’s Controversial Relationship With an Ex-Call Girl<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thomas Earle traveled with his lover to Manhattan, where he booked them a room at the Gramercy. This was after he had told his wife Alisa (Alex’s)&nbsp;mom that he was going on a business trip to Colorado. From reports, we know Thomas didn’t. Instead, he and Ashley spent a day shopping, dining, and drinking around the big apple.</p><p>They returned to the hotel, which we later learned was the same hotel where Thomas and his wife celebrate their anniversary yearly. When he returned to his hometown of Wall Township, New Jersey, a reporter tried to interview Alisa and Thomas at home about his infidelity. According to sources, Thomas told his stunned wife that a publicity-seeking Ashley had set him up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Thomas_Earles_Relationship_With_Ashley_Affect_His_Political_Career></span>How Did Thomas Earle’s Relationship With Ashley Affect His Political Career?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In a shocking turn of events, Thomas Earle’s involvement with Ashley had disastrous consequences for his political career, ultimately leading to its downfall. The revelation of their relationship sent shockwaves through the political landscape, tarnishing Earle’s reputation and eroding public trust.</p><p>The fallout from the affair proved insurmountable. The loss of public support, mounting pressure from opponents, and the erosion of credibility sealed his political fate. Thomas Earle faced the inevitable: resigning from his political position.</p><p>The once-promising trajectory of Earle’s career was abruptly halted, leaving a lasting mark on his legacy. You would think that his relationship with Ashley would also end afterward. However, the very opposite happened.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Thomas_Earle_Elope_With_Ashley></span>Did Thomas Earle Elope With Ashley?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After the scandalous relationship, Thomas and his ex-call-girl lover, Ashley, got engaged and settled down, much to the dismay of many. They reportedly got engaged in 2012 after eloping to Paris and married in a private ceremony at the top floor of the Posh George V Hotel overlooking the Eiffel Tower in 2013. The couple settled in Monmouth County.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3605b1648422fcd8abdee0bdb2a9b5b2-fotor-20230708143446.jpg><p>They have a daughter Isabel Jagger Earle. Thomas and Ashley have created a happy and fulfilling life, and she shares <a href=#>heartwarming </a>moments on social media.</p><p>In addition to being loving parents, Thomas and Ashley take pride in their pets, caring for their cat and dog with affection. Thomas also finds joy in pursuing his passion for motorcycle riding, embracing a fulfilling lifestyle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Thomas_Earles_Relationship_With_His_Ex-Wife_Alisa></span>Thomas Earle’s Relationship With His Ex-Wife, Alisa<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alisa and Thomas met at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida. Their relationship shocked at least one of Thomas’s College buddies who knew him and Alisa when they all attended the university.</p><p>Alisa was dating a soccer player when she met Thomas. Thomas did everything he could to make Alisa his as he believed he loved her then. Well, his efforts paid off as they got together soon after, his friend said in an email to The Post.</p><p>Thomas had always been a playboy, but this friend confirmed that Alisa eventually tamed the wildman. He said his wild days were over when Thomas laid his eyes on Alisia. He was infatuated when he saw her; his pal thought that didn’t change. Alisa and Thomas had two children, Alex and Ashtin Earle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Thomas_Earles_Background></span>Thomas Earle’s Background<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thomas was born to his parents, Walter Earle Sr. and Marianne Dryer Earle, in January 1973. His parents were together for over four decades until his father died in 2004 at 67.</p><p>Thomas Earle is the CEO of Earle, a well-established road construction and paving company based in New Jersey. With a legacy spanning 54 years, the company holds a unique tradition inspired by the events of September 11: each piece of its construction equipment proudly displays the American flag, symbolizing its unwavering patriotism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/23b0842ba16d3b52adbb74388a48001a-fotor-20230708143558.jpg><p>Beyond their business endeavors, the Earle family is actively involved in philanthropy. They operate a foundation with a primary focus on combating the devastating impact of opioid addiction, addressing an issue of great importance in their community.</p><p>Thomas’s extensive experience in the industry is evident through his leadership roles. He has served as the president of the New Jersey Asphalt Pavement Association for three terms and currently holds the treasurer position. Additionally, Thomas has made significant contributions to the National Asphalt Pavement Association, having served on its Board of Directors and Executive Committee from 2002 to 2010.</p><p>It’s good to know that Thomas is much more than a man involved in a scandal. <a href=#>Denise Gordy</a>, a famous face on TV screens in the US in the late 1990s, was also involved in a controversial relationship with the late superstar Marvin Gaye.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwam7zJqqZp2Rp7mmecClnLFllZa%2FrbHSZp2arJiav27DwKxkoqampLm3scNmoKdlkWKwsLrTq6avnaKotqK4jKucpZmknryvv8eip2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthomas-earle-alex-earles-father-was-involved-in-a-controversial-relationship.html&text=Thomas%20Earle%3a%20Alex%20Earles%20Father%2c%20Was%20Involved%20in%20a%20Controversial%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthomas-earle-alex-earles-father-was-involved-in-a-controversial-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthomas-earle-alex-earles-father-was-involved-in-a-controversial-relationship.html&title=Thomas%20Earle%3a%20Alex%20Earles%20Father%2c%20Was%20Involved%20in%20a%20Controversial%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthomas-earle-alex-earles-father-was-involved-in-a-controversial-relationship.html&title=Thomas%20Earle%3a%20Alex%20Earles%20Father%2c%20Was%20Involved%20in%20a%20Controversial%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthomas-earle-alex-earles-father-was-involved-in-a-controversial-relationship.html&title=Thomas%20Earle%3a%20Alex%20Earles%20Father%2c%20Was%20Involved%20in%20a%20Controversial%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthomas-earle-alex-earles-father-was-involved-in-a-controversial-relationship.html&description=Thomas%20Earle%3a%20Alex%20Earles%20Father%2c%20Was%20Involved%20in%20a%20Controversial%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tulsa-king-release-date-and-cast.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tulsa King release date and cast">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kyle-richards-real-housewives-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Real Housewives of Beverly Hillss Kyle Richards: Many Times I Wish That I Hadnt Gone on">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
