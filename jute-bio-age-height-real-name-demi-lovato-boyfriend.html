Get to know him better with this bio.</p><p>Here we cover details on his age, real name, height, and other details.</p><h3><strong>Meet Musician Jute$, Demi Lovato Boyfriend</strong></h3><p>On 20 August 2022, singer Demi Lovato received a birthday message from her beau Jute$. He wished her 30th birthday via an Instagram post which he captioned, “<span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">happy birthday, baby. ur a 30-year-old minx and I’m the luckiest schmuck in the world cuz i get to call u mine. making u laugh has become my new obsession cuz ur smile literally cures my depression (there’s a song lyric in there somewhere). I’m so proud of u for not only surviving everything you’ve been through but coming out on top and becoming ur healthiest happiest sweetest self.”</span></p><p>He concluded, “and that’s all u baby… i’m just here to support u and tell stupid dad jokes when needed. ur more than ur music, more than ur voice, more than a beautiful face. ur everything. i love u ps the last slide is the new <a class="qi72231t nu7423ey n3hqoq4p r86q59rh b3qcqh3k fq87ekyn bdao358l fsf7x5fv rse6dlih s5oniofx m8h3af8h l7ghb35v kjdc1dyq kmwttqpk srn514ro oxkhqvkx rl78xhln nch0832m cr00lzj9 rn8ck1ys s3jn8y49 icdlwmnq _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#1</a>&nbsp;cutest video on the internet. literally bursting w joy 😭 how are u real lol&nbsp;<a class="qi72231t nu7423ey n3hqoq4p r86q59rh b3qcqh3k fq87ekyn bdao358l fsf7x5fv rse6dlih s5oniofx m8h3af8h l7ghb35v kjdc1dyq kmwttqpk srn514ro oxkhqvkx rl78xhln nch0832m cr00lzj9 rn8ck1ys s3jn8y49 icdlwmnq notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@ddlovato</a>“.</p><p>Demi Lovato reacted by commenting on the post and penned a sweet comment. In her short note, Demi called Jute$ the “best boyfriend” and mentioned how grateful she is to have him in her life. Lovato wrote, “YOURE THE BEST BOYFRIEND IN THE WORLD. I’m just so grateful I get to call you mine because I’ve never laughed like this in my life, I’ve never smiled so much and my heart is constantly so full of love w you. this post, this caption… how are YOU real?! I love you honey.. so much.”</p><p>The couple was seen holding hands over the weekend at Santa Monica, California’s Giorgio Baldi, a popular hangout for celebrities. In a red mini dress, black leather jacket, fishnet stockings, and black shoes, Lovato made a statement. While her boyfriend wore a sleeveless studded sweater and a bucket hat, the birthday lady finished her ensemble with dark sunglasses and a handbag in the same color.</p><p>Page Six was informed by a source that the couple “stuck to water only” and held hands as they exited the restaurant. “They were snuggling and sneaking kisses throughout their meal,” the source added.</p><p>The couple recently went public with their relationship. They stepped out for a date in New York City on 16 August. An eyewitness told E! News that the pair “looked extremely happy” while walking hand in hand together. A source close to the Camp Rock star told the outlet that the former Disney star and the “OUT THE DOOR” singer&nbsp;have been “secretly dating for months now.”</p><p>“Things are going really well and they have a lot in common, the insider shared on Aug. 18. “They bond over music.” &nbsp;“She’s definitely smitten,” the insider explained. “Everyone thinks he is really good for her.”</p><p>The lovebirds met while collaborating on multiple songs off her latest album. Lovato furthered her and Jute$’s relationship by including a number of stories from Jute$ in her Instagram Story.</p><p>After Jute$ noted he was “unbelievably proud” of his significant other’s “timeless album,” the singer replied, “Thank you so much baby!!!! I’m so grateful for the songs we created and soooo grateful you’re mine.”</p><p>The relationship came after two years of Demi’s split from her ex-fiance Max Ehrich.</p><h3><strong>Jute$ Age</strong></h3><p>As of late August of 2022, Jute$ is 24 years old.</p><h3><strong>Jute$ Real Name</strong></h3><p>The real name of Jute$ is Jordan Lutes.</p><h3><strong>Is Jute$ On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Jute$ is on Instagram (<a href=#>@jutesmusic</a>). You can also on Twitter (<a href=#>@jutesmusic</a>) and TikTok (<a href=#>@jutesmusic</a>).</p><h3><strong>Jute$ Career And Songs</strong></h3><p>Jute$ is a Toronto-based punk/rap artist. He came from film studies and basketball background and moved on to studying music and creating music on his own time.</p><p>He has a number of EPs under his belt, including 2020’s Overrated. His most recent song, Hollywood Hillbilly, is the lead single from his new album, which will be released in October. The following single from Jute$ will be released on October 1st, 2022.</p><p>Top songs from the early 2020 album include the classics Sideshow and Start Over, which combine trap beats with edgy lyrics to evoke the rock culture of the early 2000s. His second album, A Really Bad Dream, debuted not long after this first album.</p><p>The Nuance Magazine said that Jutes’ style is the same, but he uses more experimental techniques. This music hinted at what his fans may expect in his future music projects. He previously signed to Capitol Records but he rescinded his contract with the record label to pursue a career as an independent artist.</p><p>In July 2022, when the song Substance dropped, the red-haired artist made his professional relationship with Lovato public for the first time. Calling it “one of the fav songs I’ve ever worked on,” Jute$ wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a> about the experience. “I remember thinking wtf am I supposed to do in a Demi Lovato session,” he questioned. “Only to show up and realize she was making one of the hardest rock projects I’ve ever heard.”</p><p>Moreover, the music video for Jute$’s song Funeral, dropped in October 2021, made numerous religious undertones. You can find him on <a href=#>Spotify</a>, <a href=#>SoundCloud</a>, and <a href=#>YouTube</a>. Some of his popular songs are “BOY WITH A BROKEN HEART,” “Give u a Call,” and “Say it Out Loud”.</p><p>Besides music, he is also on a mission to become substance-free in 2022. On 18 May 2022, he celebrated being 30 days sober. He added, “[The] longest I’ve gone since high school. Alcohol was my last remaining vice I used to deal [with] my anxiety and mental s***. Took me a minute to get here but doing my best to face s*** in a less harmful way these days.”</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Jute$ Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Jute$’s net worth, as we speak in 2022, should be above $600 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Jute$ Height</strong></h3><p>The tattoos which he has all over his body are without a doubt his distinct feature. However, his height measures under 5 feet 11 inches.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Jute$ Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jute$ celebrates his birthday on 29 March.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>What Do We Know About Jute$ Family?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Currently, there is no information available regarding Jute$’s family members.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Jute$ From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jute$ grew up in Ottawa, Canada.
