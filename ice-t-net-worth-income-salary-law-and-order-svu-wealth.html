Some stars, however, like <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> and <a href=#>Tom Hanks</a>, have been able to get to the top and stay there for years on end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Ice-T</a> has been a popular name since the '80s, and the man has had a genuinely underrated run in music and acting. He's done well for himself professionally, and he has the bank account to prove it.</p><p>Let's check in and see what Ice-T's fortune is looking like today.</p><h2 id=ice-t-has-had-an-amazing-career>Ice-T Has Had An Amazing Career</h2><p>Ice-T is a rare example of a performer who has had success in multiple areas of entertainment. Sure, some folks can do TV and film, but T's success has been in acting and in music.</p><p>Initially breaking out as a rapper and then the frontman of a metal band, Ice-T was a name in music long before transitioning into acting. He made waves with plenty of controversy, but he had a message that was loud and clear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon enough, the rapper would get into acting, which took his career to another level entirely. Little did he know at the time that his foray into acting would have a profound effect on how things would play out in his career.</p><p>He's continued to make music, star on a hit TV show, and he has even gotten into the writing game, as well. He can basically do it all.</p><p>As great as it is that Ice-T has seen and done it all in entertainment, the truth is that he is best known for his work in Law & Order: SVU.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>We Totally Forgot These Actors Appeared On Law & Order: SVU</a></span></p><h2 id=his-time-on-svu-has-been-legendary>His Time On SVU Has Been Legendary</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Landing on a hit show is difficult for any performer, but no one expected Ice-T to make this happen years back. Sure, he had some acting experience, but the rapper proved to be a perfect fit for SVU and what the show was looking for.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Looper</a>, "Initially, Ice-T was going to be a guest star, and Tutuola was only slated to appear in four episodes. But the character proved to be popular with the audience, so the rapper continued to play Fin throughout the second season of "SVU" and still to this day."</p><p>It's amazing to see how well he fit in, even though many questioned his decision to play a cop in the first place thanks to his gangster rap image, which included a song called "Cop Killer" with his band, Body Count.</p><p>The man, however, was all about securing the bag.</p><p>"You think because I am a rapper, I should have turned this down? That would have been stupid. I am about getting that check," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to a lengthy career, fans know that Ice-T has made bank, but they want to know if he is still worth a fortune.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why Christopher Meloni Left 'Law & Order: SVU'</a></span></p><h2 id=he-39-s-currently-worth-60-million>He's Currently Worth $60 Million</h2><p>So, what is Ice-T's net worth looking like today? Well, according to the folks over at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Ice-T is sporting a net worth of $60 million, which is nothing short of impressive. It has come on the heels of tireless work, and the man has earned every single penny in his bank account.</p><p>Obviously, a huge part of Ice-T's net worth has come from his time on Law & Order: SVU, but most people don't know how much the actor is pulling down from the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"As of this writing, Ice-T earns $250,000 per episode of "Law & Order: SVU." That works out to around $6 million per season before syndication royalties," reports Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>That is a ton of money to be making, and as the site noted, that's even before syndication kicks in. For the unfamiliar, syndication pay is what happens when previous episodes air again. Now, just think about how often SVU is playing old episodes each day, and wrap your head around the fact that Ice-T makes money for each of those episodes. Yeah, it adds up over time.</p><p>At this time, there is no concrete data about the money he has made through music and writing, but we imagine that he's pulled down a pretty penny. This is especially evident with the fact that Ice-T has played at plenty of huge venues over time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Law & Order: SVU’ Stars Christopher Meloni And Mariska Hargitay Tease Fans With Flirty Pics On Set</a></span></p><p>Ice-T has had a tremendous career in Hollywood, and thanks to this, the man will never have to worry about money for as long as he lives.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Richest Stars Of 'Law and Order SVU' Season 23, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGignJ1dqXqvsdNmrqiqpJ16qrrCqKSeZaOWuaK%2B2Gajmq9dlrulec6rm56qXajDtnnWnpilrJhk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fice-t-net-worth-income-salary-law-and-order-svu-wealth.html&text=Is%20Ice%20T%20Still%20Worth%20%2460%20Million%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fice-t-net-worth-income-salary-law-and-order-svu-wealth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fice-t-net-worth-income-salary-law-and-order-svu-wealth.html&title=Is%20Ice%20T%20Still%20Worth%20%2460%20Million%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fice-t-net-worth-income-salary-law-and-order-svu-wealth.html&title=Is%20Ice%20T%20Still%20Worth%20%2460%20Million%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fice-t-net-worth-income-salary-law-and-order-svu-wealth.html&title=Is%20Ice%20T%20Still%20Worth%20%2460%20Million%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fice-t-net-worth-income-salary-law-and-order-svu-wealth.html&description=Is%20Ice%20T%20Still%20Worth%20%2460%20Million%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./james-and-sherry-green-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James And Sherry Green Net Worth  Phone Number, House Address, Wiki">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-ronald-dead-on-big-sky.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Brian Geraghty's Ronald Pergman Really Dead on 'Big Sky'?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
