The sitcom lasted ten seasons but in truth, could've gone on for many more seasons.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a closer look at Schwimmer's life before Friends, and what his life was like. During the bulk of his 20s, Schwimmer was balancing two jobs, trying to make his Hollywood career work. However, there were struggles along the way including a traumatizing experience on the set of Monty.</p><p>This resulted in Schwimmer wanted to neglect sitcoms altogether. Schwimmer was the only choice as Ross, but he felt skeptical about accepting the offer. Let's take a look at how the situation unfolded, and why the Friends star finally decided to agree.

However, at the start of his career in Hollywood that was far from the case. <a href=#>During the majority of his 20s, Schwimmer was waiting on tables</a>. He'd take acting jobs sporadically, which were usually recurring guest spots.</p><p>He tells the Financial Times, "I would get small recurring roles — three episodes here, four episodes there.

In the same interview, the actor still remembers the specific moment his life changed, and it all took place at a Starbucks.</p><p>“I realized instinctively not to take him up on it," Schwimmer reveals after he was advised to cut the line. "There were six other people in front of me and I knew they would look at me and think I was a dick. I worked really hard, against a lot of forces, to retain some normalcy.”</p><p>Despite the success and fame, the opportunity almost vanished. Schwimmer was the last cast member to join Friends, and he was very indecisive at the start given his experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-schwimmer-wanted-to-avoid-sitcoms-after-feeling-like-a-prop-on-the-show-monty>David Schwimmer Wanted To Avoid Sitcoms After Feeling Like A Prop On The Show, Monty</h2><p>Friends could have looked very different. Others were considered for certain roles, including Courteney Cox taking on the part of Rachel. As for David Schwimmer, he was always the only candidate to play Ross, but the actor struggled with the decision at the start.</p><p>According to director James Burrows, that would all stem from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Schwimmer's experience in the TV show, Monty.</a> David tried using his creative output during the show, but was basically shut down by the crew. This caused Schwimmer to look elsewhere for work outside of sitcoms.</p><p>Burrows revealed, "He was concerned that the show wasn't going to be collaborative, and his ideas wouldn't be welcome. We assured him that this experience would be different and it would be an ensemble."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Did Adam Sandler Really Miss Out On Friends With Jennifer Aniston Because Of David Schwimmer's Height?</a></span></p><p>David stated that he felt like a prop during his time on the series, and was basically told to just say his lines. Thankfully, he reconsidered for Friends and along the way, the actor gave a lot of his own creative output as it pertains to Ross and the others as well, producing episodes behind the scenes.</p><h2 id=david-schwimmer-didn-39-t-have-to-audition-for-his-role-on-friends>David Schwimmer Didn't Have To Audition For His Role On Friends</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/your-paragraph-text-19.png><p>The search for the cast of Friends was not an easy one. According to word behind the scenes, 500 auditions took place in order to find the main cast... As for David Schwimmer, well he was the first and only choice. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor was the only one of the main cast that didn't audition</a> given the experience he already had with those behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"David Schwimmer we worked with before, and the writers had him in mind for the part of Ross. Lisa and Jennifer and Matthew and Matt we cast from auditions. Courteney we originally wanted to play Rachel, and she insisted she wasn't Rachel but Monica. And she was right."</p><p>Schwimmer thrived in the role and his career instantly changed. David was among the first to receive offers from other Hollywood film sets, particularly movies. David was even considered for Men in Black at the start - no doubt such a role in a franchise would've enhanced David's career that much more. The actor decided to take on work behind the camera as well after his time on Friends. He enjoyed continued success following the sitcom's epic decade long run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXq0r8ewoKallad6orjMqKqtZaKat6av056bZqCZqHqnvsiepZ2rXaSzp7HRZpifrJWneqJ506uYrqWRqbakecSxp56qmZq7pLGMqKVmpZ%2Bjwbp7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-schwimmer-almost-rejected-his-friends-offer-after-a-traumatic-experience-on-monty.html&text=David%20Schwimmer%20Almost%20Banned%20His%20Friends%20Offer%20After%20A%20Traumatic%20Hollywood%20Experience%20On%20A%20Differen&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-schwimmer-almost-rejected-his-friends-offer-after-a-traumatic-experience-on-monty.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-schwimmer-almost-rejected-his-friends-offer-after-a-traumatic-experience-on-monty.html&title=David%20Schwimmer%20Almost%20Banned%20His%20Friends%20Offer%20After%20A%20Traumatic%20Hollywood%20Experience%20On%20A%20Differen" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-schwimmer-almost-rejected-his-friends-offer-after-a-traumatic-experience-on-monty.html&title=David%20Schwimmer%20Almost%20Banned%20His%20Friends%20Offer%20After%20A%20Traumatic%20Hollywood%20Experience%20On%20A%20Differen" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-schwimmer-almost-rejected-his-friends-offer-after-a-traumatic-experience-on-monty.html&title=David%20Schwimmer%20Almost%20Banned%20His%20Friends%20Offer%20After%20A%20Traumatic%20Hollywood%20Experience%20On%20A%20Differen" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-schwimmer-almost-rejected-his-friends-offer-after-a-traumatic-experience-on-monty.html&description=David%20Schwimmer%20Almost%20Banned%20His%20Friends%20Offer%20After%20A%20Traumatic%20Hollywood%20Experience%20On%20A%20Differen" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./diery-claudia-maree-mailer-social-media-interview.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="DieRys Claudia Maree Mailer &amp;amp; Director Jennifer Gelfer Discuss Haunting Side Of Social M">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./grammys-2020-a-star-is-born-wins-two-more-awards-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Star Is Born Just Won Two Grammys, Jackson Maine Sadly Not Onstage to Pee">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
