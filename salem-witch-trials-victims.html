But he suffered an especially gruesome death. After refusing to plead guilty to practicing wizardry, he was “pressed” to death with stones.</p><p>Before his death, Giles had something of an infamous reputation in Salem. The 80-year-old farmer had stood trial for killing a farmhand years earlier, and church records even referred to him as a “scandalous person.”</p><p>Nevertheless, Giles reacted to the Salem witch trials like most other people in town. Curious and frightened, he attended many of the early examinations. Giles even felt hysterical enough about potential witchcraft that he agreed that his own wife, Martha, was probably a witch.</p><p>He testified against her, acknowledging that he’d had some animals fall mysteriously ill and that he had seen his wife behave strangely near a fire.</p><p>But then suspicion fell on him. A number of young women claimed that he’d bewitched them. And just like in Bishop’s case, they went into violent fits almost as soon as he walked into the courtroom.</p><p>“All the afflicted were seized now with fits, and troubled with pinches,” Reverend Samuel Parris <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote</a>. “Then the court ordered his hands to be tied.”</p><p>The magistrate demanded: “What, is it not enough to act witchcraft at other times, but must you do it now in the face of authority?”</p><p>“I am a poor creature, and cannot help it,” Giles responded, but as he moved his head, the young women he’d “bewitched” echoed his movement.</p><p>Perhaps sensing the futility of defending himself, Giles eventually stopped cooperating. But because he refused to talk, he was given a sentence of peine forte et dure. In other words, he’d be pressed to death.</p><p>In September 1692, that’s exactly what happened. Giles was stripped naked and laid on the ground with a board covering his body. One by one, stones were stacked onto the board as Corey cried out, “More weight!” while he was crushed to death. It took him days to die on September 19, 1692.</p><p>In the end, his only goal was stopping authorities from taking his land so that his two sons-in-law would at least be left with something. And although he was able to ensure the prosperity of his surviving family members, he suffered an agonizing death in order to make that happen.</p><p>Martha Corey avoided this terrible fate. But she too was executed for being a witch. On September 22, she and seven others were hanged.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony0rcuepGavmamwqXnTq6CapKNiw6qv06KkrGdj</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsalem-witch-trials-victims.html&text=8%20Salem%20Witch%20Trial%20Victims%20Executed%20For%20Their%20Alleged%20Demonic%20Crimes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsalem-witch-trials-victims.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsalem-witch-trials-victims.html&title=8%20Salem%20Witch%20Trial%20Victims%20Executed%20For%20Their%20Alleged%20Demonic%20Crimes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsalem-witch-trials-victims.html&title=8%20Salem%20Witch%20Trial%20Victims%20Executed%20For%20Their%20Alleged%20Demonic%20Crimes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsalem-witch-trials-victims.html&title=8%20Salem%20Witch%20Trial%20Victims%20Executed%20For%20Their%20Alleged%20Demonic%20Crimes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsalem-witch-trials-victims.html&description=8%20Salem%20Witch%20Trial%20Victims%20Executed%20For%20Their%20Alleged%20Demonic%20Crimes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./apprentice-winner-trump-wanted-sex-with-women-contestants-w445062.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Apprentice Winner: Trump Wanted Sex With Women Contestants">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-sumedh-mudgalkar-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-rumours-and-facts-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Sumedh Mudgalkar Dating Now?
