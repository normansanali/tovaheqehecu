While his&nbsp;grandfather, John Whedon, is known for his work on radio and The Donna Reed Show in the 1950s.</p><p>Whedon’s mother, Ann Lee, had a small fan base for her work as an activist at Riverdale Country School, where she inspired many with her visions as a feminist.</p><p>The family’s influence and love for drama resulted in family trips, which included reciting Shakespeare and other influential writers.</p><p>This, unfortunately, became an issue with the family, as Joss has reported how he and his two brothers would go through some sort of punishment from their parents if they were not creative or witty enough.</p><p>Joss experienced some childhood trauma at the age of 5 when his best friend drowned.</p><p>Four years later, Joss’s parents divorced, which didn’t help the already struggling child.
