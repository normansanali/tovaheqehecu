In doing so, The Queen’s Gambit contributed to Netflix becoming the <a href=#>most successful network at the Emmys</a> last year.</p><p>Within a month of being made available to stream, the show had also officially become Netflix’s most watched scripted limited series, and was topping the charts in multiple countries.</p><p>This was only the upside, however. One of the main challenges that the streamer faced from The Queen’s Gambit was <a href=#>a lawsuit brought against them</a> that has been drawn out for the last one year. That suit – by one Nona Gaprindashvili – was eventually settled earlier this month. Here is everything we know about it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was Anya Taylor-Joy Underpaid For Her Role In 'The Queen's Gambit'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-the-queen-rsquo-s-gambit-about><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>What Is The Queen’s Gambit About?</span></h2><p>The Queen’s Gambit is the story of “Nine-year-old Beth Harmon, a shy, withdrawn girl [who] is sent to an orphanage after her mother dies in a car accident.” This is according to one plot summary on IMDb.</p><p>“She finds a purpose when the school janitor teaches her to play chess.

The book was written by author Walter Tevis, and was released in 1983 by the publisher Random House.</p><p>Scottish filmmaker Allan Scott purchased the rights for the novel in 1992 and eventually partnered with Logan writer Scott Frank to write the screenplay for the Netflix production.
