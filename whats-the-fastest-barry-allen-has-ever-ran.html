Barry is more than your average speed demon, too; by tapping into the Speed Force, an extra-dimensional energy source, he can move backwards and forwards in time and even across dimensions.</span></span><h2>What is the fastest Barry Allen has ever gone?</h2>Dividing the speed of light by 80 reveals Barry Allen's top speed as The Flash to be roughly 8.3 million mph (13.5 million km/h ) or Mach 10,925. It's possible this is a measure of how fast Barry is without fully tapping the Speed Force, which he presumably did to protect Big Sir and himself in the aforementioned case.<h2>How fast can Barry Allen run a mile?</h2>Just how fast is The Flash?

A fan of the scarlet speedster, Wally West gained his superpowers in a lab accident similar to Barry Allen.</p><h2>Who is faster than Savitar?</h2>3. Savitar - Barry was the only speedster fast enough to beat Savitar. Eobard could beat him too as he is from the future (and knows everything) and the Negative Force (His powers) mimic the Speed Force (Barry's powers). Savitar is also self proclaimed, “the God of Speed”.<h2>How fast can quicksilver run?</h2>According to internet sleuths and amateur mathematicians, Quicksilver's speed is around 2,050 miles-per-second, a number that is much faster than the speed of sound. That's quite a bit shy of the speed of light, however, which clocks in at 186,000 miles-per-second.

By applying the same formula, this means that Goku, without Instant Transmission, can travel 22.321 trillion MPH -- or 33,314 times the speed of light!<h2>What's flash's top speed?</h2>Unfortunately for fans, it's not quite the speed of light. According to The Flash, Allen's top speed is Mach 3.3, or 2,532 miles per hour.<h2>How was savitar so fast?</h2>The suit gives its wearer speed as the wearer gives off static electricity. Tracy Brand theorized that Savitar gives off so much speed and power when he runs that the suit protects him and keeps it from overwhelming him.<h2>How fast is the black flash?</h2>According to Max Mercury one touch from the Black Flash, can cause instant death. Superhuman Speed: The Black Flash can move at vast superhuman speeds, easily keeping up with Barry Allen, and surpassing the speed of light.<h2>Who's the fastest in Marvel?</h2><p>Marvel: The 20 Fastest Speedsters, Ranked</p><li>1 The Runner Is An Elder Of The Universe, Devoting Eons To Developing Speed.</li><li>2 Hermes Is The Greek God That Started The Fascination With Speedsters. ...</li><li>3 FastForward Is Marvel's Fastest Man Alive Who Might Have Also Been The Flash. ...</li><h2>Who is the fastest hero?</h2><p>The Top 10 Fastest Superheroes In Marvel and DC Comic Books Today</p><li>Wally West.
