Despite undergoing surgery, Andrews will be sidelined for the remainder of the 2023 season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-unfortunate-injury>The Unfortunate Injury</h2><p class=has-text-align-left>During a game against the Cincinnati Bengals, the unfortunate injury struck Mark Andrews when he was tackled by Logan Wilson, leading to a cracked fibula and ankle ligament injury. The force of the impact compelled Andrews to exit the game and, regrettably, ruled him out for the rest of the season.

Before the injury, Andrews was enjoying a standout season, poised to attain his first 1,000 receiving yards and 10 receiving touchdowns in a single season.
