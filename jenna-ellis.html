She then went on to earn a law degree from the University of Richmond School of Law in 2011.</p><p>After law school, Ellis worked as a law clerk for a federal judge in Colorado. She then joined the Weld County District Attorney’s Office, where she served as a deputy district attorney for two years.</p><p>In 2017, Ellis joined the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom. She worked for ADF for two years, before joining Trump’s legal team in November 2019.</p><p>As a member of Trump’s legal team, Ellis was a vocal advocate for Trump’s claims of election fraud. She appeared on numerous cable news shows to promote Trump’s false claims, and she also drafted two memos falsely asserting that Vice President Mike Pence could change the results of the election.</p><p>Ellis’s work on Trump’s legal team was widely criticized by legal experts. They pointed out that Ellis had no experience in election law, and that her claims of election fraud were baseless.</p><p>In January 2021, Ellis was one of the lawyers who argued Trump’s case in front of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court rejected Trump’s case, and Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States.</p><p>Since leaving Trump’s legal team, Ellis has continued to promote Trump’s false claims of election fraud. She has also appeared on numerous conservative media outlets to attack the Biden administration.</p><p>Ellis is a controversial figure.

She is a talented lawyer and a gifted communicator. However, she has also been criticized for her lack of experience, her promotion of false claims, and her attacks on the Biden administration. Only time will tell what the lasting impact of her career will be.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jenna_Ellis_Career></span><strong>Jenna Ellis Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jenna Ellis’ career as a lawyer and political commentator has been somewhat contentious. Her work as a member of Donald Trump’s legal team during the 2020 election is what made her most well-known.</p><p>After graduating from the University of Richmond School of Law in 2011, Ellis started her profession. She served as a legal assistant for a federal judge in Colorado following law school. She subsequently started working for the Weld County District Attorney’s Office, where she spent two years as a deputy district attorney.</p><p>Ellis joined the libertarian legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom in 2017. She spent two years working for ADF before joining Trump’s legal counsel in November 2019.</p><p>Ellis, who was a member of Trump’s legal team, was a fervent supporter of Trump’s allegations of election fraud. She made many appearances on cable news programs to forward Trump’s untrue assertions, and she also wrote two memos that falsely suggested Vice President Mike Pence might influence the outcome of the election.</p><p>Legal experts slammed Ellis’ work on Trump’s legal team in general. They made it clear that Ellis had no background in electoral law and that her allegations of fraud were unfounded.</p><p>Ellis was one of the solicitors that presented Trump’s argument before the Supreme Court in January 2021. Trump’s appeal was denied by the Supreme Court, and Biden took office as the country’s 46th president.</p><p>Ellis has continued to advance Trump’s phony charges of election fraud ever since he left Trump’s legal team. In order to criticize the Biden administration, she has also been featured in a number of conservative media outlets.</p><p>Ellis is a contentious individual. She has come under fire for her inexperience, for spreading inaccurate information, and for criticizing the Biden administration. She is still well-liked by Trump fans, though.</p><p>Ellis has worked as a legal analyst for Fox News and a commenter for the conservative website The Federalist in addition to her position on Trump’s legal team. In addition, she is the author of “The Legal Basis for a Moral Constitution: A Guide for Christians to Understand America’s Constitutional Crisis.”</p><p>Throughout his career, Ellis has had both accomplishments and setbacks. She has gained considerable notoriety as a legal analyst and political pundit, but she has also come under fire for her inexperience and for endorsing untrue statements. The long-term effects of her profession are yet to be determined.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jenna_Ellis_Education_Father_Lawyer_Husband_Net_Worth_Wedding></span><strong>Jenna Ellis Education, Father, Lawyer, Husband, Net Worth, Wedding</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Education:</strong>&nbsp;Ellis graduated from Cedarville University in Ohio with a degree in political science in 2006.
