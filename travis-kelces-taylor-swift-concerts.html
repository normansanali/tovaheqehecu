When Swift gets into a relationship, she is all in. There is no being careful and no protecting of her heart. Because of the fearlessness that Swift has shown with not giving up on love, she has faced her fair share of heartbreak. While this has made for hit songs, allowed Swift to break records, and make a fortune, it has yet to lead her to the happily ever after Swift desires to have.</p><p><a href=#>Swift has dated several different men over the years</a>. The men she dated had different types of careers, were different ages, and had different levels of achievement in their fields. What the men have all had in common, however, is their inability to not feel intimidated by Swift's success. This caused Swift to feel she had to change to fit a mold she thought these men wanted of her, only to discover that changing herself was not going to make them love her like Swift loved them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/the-eras-tour-taylor-swift-s-most-memorable-off-script-moments-so-far-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Eras Tour: Taylor Swift’s Most Memorable Off-Script Moments (So Far)">The Eras Tour: Taylor Swift’s Most Memorable Off-Script Moments (So Far)</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's 'Eras Tour' has been memorable for many reasons, but not everything has gone according to plan...</p><p>But when Swift started dating <strong><a href=#>Travis Kelce,</a></strong> it was clear there was a different dynamic to the relationship. Kelce was not afraid of being in the spotlight. He did not shy away from paparazzi presence. Kelce was present. Despite this, Travis Kelce's behavior at Taylor Swift's concerts has fans upset. They are so upset, in fact, that now their opinions have formed, there is nothing that will change their minds about Swift's main squeeze.</p><h2 id=fans-love-how-travis-kelce-acts-during-taylor-swift-39-s-concerts>Fans Love How Travis Kelce Acts During Taylor Swift's Concerts</h2><h3 id=travis-kelce-sings-dances-and-interacts-with-fans-during-taylor-swift-39-s-concerts>Travis Kelce sings, dances, and interacts with fans during Taylor Swift's concerts</h3><p>Kelce was a fan of Swift's before he ever met her. He showed up at Arrowhead Stadium to watch Swift perform and was blown away by the show she put on for her fans. Kelce said as much on his podcast, New Heights, at the same time he confessed that Swift shut him down when Kelce tried to meet her backstage at the concert.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/travis-kelce-7.jpg><p>Since Kelce and Swift have become a couple, Kelce has been in attendance at more than half a dozen of Swift's Eras Tour dates.

But some feel bad for what Kelce has had to endure along the way.</p><p>Kelce is the epitome of a supportive boyfriend. He does not expect Swift to do all the heavy lifting in the relationship and reciprocates instead. This has allowed Swift to not only be herself but to shine during her tour, which is uncharted territory for The Tortoured Poets Department artist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-fans-think-joe-alwyn-was-never-supportive-of-taylor-swift>Why Fans Think Joe Alwyn Was Never Supportive Of Taylor Swift</h2><h3 id=joe-alwyn-never-looked-happy-to-be-at-taylor-swift-39-s-concerts-even-when-she-was-singing-songs-about-him>Joe Alwyn never looked happy to be at Taylor Swift's concerts, even when she was singing songs about him</h3><p>During the six years that <strong><a href=#>Joe Alwyn</a></strong> and Swift dated, Alwyn was seen attending one show from the Reputation Tour, which was the opening date. While some Swift fans have stated that he may have attended a few more but was just backstage, it is unclear if this is true.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/joe-alwyn-gq-men-of-the-year-awards.jpg><p>During the Reputation Tour date that Alwyn was confirmed to attend, he showed very little emotion, even with songs that were clearly about him being sung. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This lack of emotion has been attributed to Alwyn being an introvert</a>. However, it has also been perceived as Alwyn not being supportive of Swift and not being able to handle her star shining brighter than his.</p><p>"Fricking Joe always looked miserable," one fan said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another fan explained, "People are saying, 'Don't compare an introvert with an extrovert.'

Healy attended several of Swift's Eras Tour dates. Healy looked happy to be in the crowd and happy to support Swift.

It is the fact that for the first time after so many relationships, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift is with someone who wants to support her as much as she wants to support him</a>. This fact has been proven time and again with Kelce not only showing up to Swift's concert but making sure he interacts with fans, all while being genuine.</p><p>"He loves her out loud!!" one fan wrote. "I've never rooted for a celeb couple like I do these two."</p><p>Another said, "Okay but the way he's so sweet about it and seems genuinely happy to be doing it.

"I love this man."</p><p>While there is some speculation that Swift and Kelce are using one another to boost their careers, more people at this point believe that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor and Travis are really are in the relationship for the long haul</a> versus looking to get something from one another.</p><p>"I think Kelce pursued Taylor. She felt surprised and she liked that… He is secure enough in himself," one fan wrote. "He doesn’t 'need her money,' nor does he need more. She doesn’t have to wonder, 'Does he like me for my money?' She is certainly secure enough financially."</p><p>Another fan said, "I think they're love. In genuine love and the love for one another doesn't have anything to do with either of their careers."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp6rXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwW6vzqeanqqkqHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftravis-kelces-taylor-swift-concerts.html&text=Watching%20Travis%20Kelce%20At%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Concerts%20Has%20Fans%20Feeling%20Sad&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftravis-kelces-taylor-swift-concerts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-kelces-taylor-swift-concerts.html&title=Watching%20Travis%20Kelce%20At%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Concerts%20Has%20Fans%20Feeling%20Sad" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftravis-kelces-taylor-swift-concerts.html&title=Watching%20Travis%20Kelce%20At%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Concerts%20Has%20Fans%20Feeling%20Sad" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-kelces-taylor-swift-concerts.html&title=Watching%20Travis%20Kelce%20At%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Concerts%20Has%20Fans%20Feeling%20Sad" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftravis-kelces-taylor-swift-concerts.html&description=Watching%20Travis%20Kelce%20At%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Concerts%20Has%20Fans%20Feeling%20Sad" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./when-should-i-start-grunt-calls.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="When should I start grunt calls?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vanderpump-villa-trailer-hulu-vanderpump-rules-1235859110.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vanderpump Villa Trailer: Hulu Launches Its Own Vanderpump Rules After Scandoval">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
